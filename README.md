Dual-stream Hybrid-based Prototypical Network for Video Anomaly Detection

In this paper, we propose the Dual-stream Hybrid-based Prototypical Network (DHPNet), which develops an effective integration of multimodal information in video through frame prediction and optical flow reconstruction. Furthermore, to enhance the diversity and discernibility of the stored normal mode, we design a Learnable Sparse Prototype Unit (LSP) and introduce separation and orthogonality loss functions. Through this unit, which is memory-free, our method also helps in reducing storage memory requirements. In addition, a Channel-Spatial Attention Enhanced Skip Feature Fusion (CSFF) is introduced to capture long-distance dependencies and channel information. Extensive experiment results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method.
